Linear Regression Project: EUR/USD Prices Prediction
Objective
This training project aims to predict the EUR/USD exchange rates using linear regression. The project is for educational purposes, providing insights into building and evaluating a predictive model based on historical financial data.

Data
In this project, we work with a dataset that includes historical EUR/USD exchange rates. The data includes the following features:

Date: The date on which the data was recorded.
SPX: Closing price of the S&P 500 Index. Represents the performance of 500 major U.S. companies.
GLD: Price of the SPDR Gold Shares ETF. Tracks the value of gold.
USO: Price of the United States Oil Fund ETF. Reflects the value of crude oil.
SLV: Price of the iShares Silver Trust ETF. Tracks the value of silver.
EUR/USD: Exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. Dollar. Shows how many U.S. Dollars one Euro can buy.
Note: The dataset used in this project is for educational purposes and may not reflect real-time financial data.

Key Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
Model Building: Developed a linear regression model to predict EUR/USD prices.
Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
